Truth,@FAFOGFY,Afrocentrism,Pinkwashing is approaching Afrocentrism territory.  Do better.
Yhawach,@Yhawach,Afrocentrism,I don't support afrocentrism/ Eurocentrism or white wash or black wash any race or claim any thing to what it isn't is wrong  I certainly don't believe they were white they had darker skin with varying shades  I have a dark skin and so did my grandparents and those before them
Since I'm Here,@since_m,Afrocentrism,Maha Shehata & Aikk Yasser created a petition to halt the upcoming documentary because it was "falsifying history." A group's desire to claim Egypt's history & deprive the true Egyptians of it is being pushed via the pseudoscience known as “afrocentrism.”  https://thearchaeologist.org/blog/greeks-and-egyptians-demand-an-end-to-the-falsification-of-queen-cleopatras-history-almost-60k-sign-the-petition-to-stop-netflixs-new-documentary?format=amp…
Brida,@Brida96,Afrocentrism,It's because 1: she decided to backwash a Greek woman and make her black to suit her afrocentrism.  2: it sucks. Like it's so focused on making ppl black that it didn't focus on anything else. It's supposed to be a docuseries. But historical accuracy is lacking.
Eurasian Emperor,@empireenjoyer10,Afrocentrism,The greatest threat to Eurasians is Afrocentrism. This problem will only grow in the coming years as their population grows. They openly chant for European deaths today  and assault Asians and Indians in both South Africa and the US.
Ipyana Wasret,@IpyanaWasret,Afrocentrism,I don't think I have ever been so impacted by one discussion in my entire life as I was in listening to  @GlennLoury 's interview with  @GalorOded . It's like Thomas Sowell meets Afrocentrism w/  @AfricanaCarr  and merges neatly into a beautiful understanding of homosapien humanity.

Amir Tadros Raafat Fully Vaccinated #sinopharm,,Coptic Church,I have come to you from the Coptic Church  which was established in ancient times  through a prophecy in the book of the prophet Isaiah “In that day there will be an altar to the Lord in the midst of the land of Egypt  and a pillar to the Lord at its border.“  #this_is_egypt  3>>
_-_-_-_-,@HolakKof,Coptic Church,You think they don’t know that the Catholic Church and the Coptic Church is in Schism?   I’m not denying their sainthood but to claim that they are material schismatics is wrong
Uniate Papist, Proud Popesplainer,@davidfig1596,Coptic Church,There have been several miracles through their intercession approved by the Coptic Church

CARTER EMBREY,@carter_embrey,Coptic Church,JOIN AN EASTERN ORTHODOX OR GREEK ORHODOX CHURCH A ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCH OR A COPTIC  CHURCH AVOID SMALL PROTESTANT CHURCHES
Beth-Nabu,@BethNabu,Coptic Church,Veto or no veto  it’s honestly better and less headache to mingle with Coptic Church  they should be left alone  even the other middle eastern churches like Syriac Churches etc are not very comfortable with them in my opinion
Clare Mulligan,@clarebmulligan,Coptic Church,Most peculiar.  The Coptic Church is not even in communion with the Eastern Orthodox Churches (Russian  Greek  etc.)  but only with the Armenian Apostolic Church  the Ethiopian Orthodox Church and several others (the Oriental Orthodox Churches). They are miaphysites  a heresy.
Omar ELSABAGH,@ElsabaghOmar,Coptic Church,Coptic language still used in Egyptian Coptic church and Egypt is a 6k years history English today is totally different from English 1000 years ago

Gwen2018,@Gwen20181,Coptic Church,There is a Black Saint in the Coptic Church  he was Ethiopian not Egyptian.  The story of his life and faith is pretty cool. https://orthodox.net/redeemingthetime/2009/09/10/abba-moses-the-ethiopian-icon-sayings-and-life/…
Candace Lukasik,@lukasik_c,Coptic Church,“Pope Francis concluded his address by speaking to the Coptic bishops and faithful gathered… ‘I implore Almighty God  that  through the intercession of the saints and martyrs of the Coptic Church  He might help us to grow in communion.’”

Gbénró Adégbolá ن,@GbenroAdegbola,Coptic Church,The Coptic Church is an ethnic church  in that you have to be born a Copt to be Coptic! There very few non Copt Coptics.  Each Copt carries a tribal mark given at birth or baptism  of a cross tattooed or incised on the wrist or arm.
Sora silmolee,@LFilate,Coptic Church,No need to go for religious conflict.Oromo coptic christians can pull out of Eth coptic chutch in mass & create their own getting a patriach  appointed from Egypt for sometimes & follow their faith.The other peaceful means is to join Lutheran faith & impoverish Eth coptic church.
Delalorm Semabia,@Delalorm,Coptic Church,The Catholic Church has accorded martyrdom to Matthew Ayariga and the 20 who were killed by ISIS in Libya. The Coptic Church already recognises their martyrdom.
Fett,@fetticxc,Coptic Church,Then I'd like to see it clarified that these martyrs were not saved because of any legitimacy on the Coptic church's part  because I question whether the Holy Father truly believes that.
Geoff 1st Earl Fos an Mogh. 〓〓,@Geoffre77831787,Coptic Church,The Coptic church is an amazing and wonderful church. Was privileged to be invited to one of their Eucharist.
Patrick G,@AskThePatrick,Coptic Church,Not a Christian here  but I find this gesture of reconciliation between two branches of Christianity  separated since the 4th century (the Coptic Church is an Oriental Orthodox church  not an Eastern Orthodox one)  very touching. It's the only other church to be headed by a Pope.
Kowalski,@the_turambar,Coptic Church,Interesting  I didn't know the Coptic church had someone holding the office of Pope. What area exactly does he have jurisdiction over  and how different are his claims to authority compared to the pope of Rome?
Grant Hillman,@GrantJHillman,Coptic Church,They're not on our calendar of saints but since the Coptic Church is part of the same church body as the Armenian Church they're naturally saints for us as well by association
MwanzoTV,@MwanzoTv,Coptic Church,Christian worshippers were attacked in a Khartoum-area Coptic church during mass on Sunday  both warring sides claimed  blaming each other for the attack. The #Sudanese military  under army chief Abdel Fattah al-Burhan  said in a statement.
Coptic Archives,@copticarchives,Coptic Church,Copts resisted speaking Arabic for nearly 200 years but eventually gave in to the new language due to pressure as culture & religion shifted. Even though Arabic became the spoken & written language of Copts as well as the Coptic church  the Coptic language did not disappear.
G ♱,@grevstv,Coptic Church,I’m OO through and through man but there’s absolutely nothing wrong with watching spiritual videos from those in EO like Father Spyridon  my Coptic church has numerous collaborations with EO in discussion but it’s never on doctrine of Christology - that’s the difference lol
Samuel,@DocDefender,Coptic Church,Since the Coptic Church possesses valid sacraments  it shares sacramental unity with the Roman Pontiff. So the martyrs were invisibly within the bosom of the Universal Church.  This Holy and Catholic Church has always differentiated between heretics and schismatics.
Fr Dylan Schrader,@FrDylanSchrader,Coptic Church,The further challenge is that canonization could also be interpreted as a heavy-handed exercise of authority by the Bishop of Rome (i.e.  as implying that recognition by the Coptic Church was insufficient). I hope issues about perception don't overshadow the good of these martyrs
BillySnoop,@BillyBall3,Coptic Church,And to be perfectly honest there's barely a Coptic Church left to reunify with.
ABS-CBN News Channel,@ANCALERTS,Coptic Church,Christian worshippers were attacked in a Khartoum-area Coptic church during mass on Sunday  both warring sides claimed  blaming each other.
Gee,@EGee254,Coptic Church,#Sudan: The #RSF is claiming that the attack on St. George Coptic Church earlier today in Omdurman was from a Sudanese air force air strike
Joseph Fox,@foxlink38,Coptic Church,not from what ive read. There has been talks with the Coptic church and the Orthodox church mending their Schism but thats doubtful to be something that happens in our lifetime.
Gbénró Adégbolá ن,@GbenroAdegbola,Coptic Church,The Coptic Church had been a historically persecuted church for 1 500 yrs.   More recently they’ve suffered harassment and terrible violence in the hands of Muslim Brotherhood supporters.
La Croix Int.,@LaCroixInt,Coptic Church,Pope Tawadros II of Alexandria  who is in Rome this week  is trying to reform the Coptic-Orthodox Church despite resistance from conservatives close to his predecessor
La Croix Int.,@LaCroixInt,Coptic Church,Ten years into Pope Tawadros' pontificate  the Coptic Church is showing signs of openness and gradual evolution  though observers say it is not undergoing profound changes.
Salt + Light Media,@saltandlighttv,Coptic Church,Pope Francis to Tawadros II: "I implore God Almighty  by the intercession of the Saints and Martyrs of the Coptic Church  that He may help us grow in communion  in a single and holy bond of faith  hope and Christian love." #GeneralAudience #PopeFrancis
Mike Lewis,@mfjlewis,Coptic Church,I should note that the Coptic Church was ahead of us in this  with the canonization of Matthew Ayariga - rightly recognized as a martyr because he died for the same God  no matter his background.  (I'm curious - do Egyptian sources reveal more about him than English ones?)
Thomas Wystrach,@wystrach,Coptic Church,#Papst #Tawadros II. von #Alexandria  der diese Woche in Rom weilt  versucht  die koptisch-#orthodoxe #Kirche zu reformieren – trotz des Widerstands von Konservativen  die seinem Vorgänger nahestehen: https://bit.ly/42r0Ytc #Konfessionskunde #Kirchenreform (via  @LaCroixInt )

supertriqui,@supertriqui,Egyptian Pharaohs,Egypt was a big empire that lasted millennia. We are closer to the last Pharaoh  than the last Pharaoh is from the first.  Some Egyptian  and some Pharaohs  were black (Nubian). Some of them  more powerful than Cleopatra. But Cleopatra was a Ptolemaic. She was Greek.

Inside and around the pyramids  many inscriptions and cartouches contain the names of pharaohs  who commissioned the construction of the pyramids.

Bishop,@Slick_Risk,Egyptian Pharaohs,Okay let's make this then. Go ahead because you're just gonna say something stupid. Egyptian pharaohs were never black. They were Greek  Macedonian  and Roman. But since you're clearly and expert on the culture even though you don't live there let's see your privilege show.

Master of None,@NotaBotUR,Egyptian Pharaohs,It’s a docudrama  meant to entertain. Seeing that we have no idea who her mother was & the propensity of pharaohs to sleep with whomever they wished  she could have been part Egyptian  Roman  Persian  Nubian  whatever. Least likely is lily white skin and blue eyes like Liz Taylor
Mr. Misr,@MrMisr1,Egyptian Pharaohs,6/10: The Valley of the Kings near Luxor contains the tombs of numerous pharaohs  such as Tutankhamun and Ramesses II. Inside the tombs are wall paintings  hieroglyphics  and inscriptions showing Egyptian religious beliefs  mythologies  and rituals.
TheWillofRome,@WillofRome,Egyptian Pharaohs,Well she's not actually a member of the Ptolemaic dynasty. She's a Ptolemy in terms of her allegance to the Ptolemaic army and Greco-Egyptian vision of the Pharaohs

SoDarktheConofMan,@ConofSo,Egyptian Pharaohs,No. Her grandfather to the 5th degree was (Ptolemy I) Macedonian. He sired the line leading to Cleopatra with an Egyptian. (Who was considered "Macedonian by marriage")  Almost all Egytian Pharaohs from that point were also sired by Egyptian wives or consorts.
Evil Pookie,@QueenOfKiwis,Egyptian Pharaohs,"They have Aryan in their name"   Arya exists.  Aryas name exists.  It's a name meaning Noble  and the Nazis co-opted the word Aryan.   The Egyptian pharaohs believed themselves closer to gods than men.
Ferens Art Gallery,@HullFerens,Egyptian Pharaohs,Tutankhamun is probably the most famous of the Egyptian pharaohs but there is still a lot that remains a mystery.

Dr Rebecca Tidy,@DrRebeccaTidy,Egyptian Pharaohs,The ancient Egyptian pharaohs cursed anyone who entered a tomb whether it was thieves or archeologists.  And the creators of Encrochat probably did the same because most of the NCA officers involved have mysteriously disappeared from the agency. 
Thaivabalan Balasundaram,@ThaivabalaNBala,Egyptian Pharaohs,Infact  Armenian Jews infiltrated Cananite part of Palestine around BC-3500  within 100 years they went to screw up Scorpion of the Egyptian 1st Dynasty Pharaohs. Door of Sinai!

Son of Garima,@Garimian,Egyptian Pharaohs,Without deep argument  Ancient Egyptian were probably more brown in skin. After Babylonian conquest  Native Pharaohs have been changed by conqueror. Then after Ptolemaic dynasty   Egyptian& Greek have been intermixed both in race  deities  culture and language for Millennia. 2/3
geodude,@gogopedroe,Egyptian Pharaohs,Every state changes given time. Wasn't the roman empire roman because it became an monotheistic empire? We can only call Egypt Egyptian when referring the new kingdom's Pharaohs?

Hunter-Drakenburg,@Hunter0zz,Egyptian Pharaohs,I bet it isn’t: Hatti  Hitti  Catti  Cotti  Scotti. The Scottish are Hittites. The Egyptian Pharaohs were Hittite. The hieroglyphics derive from Hittite cuneiform. Hittite history has been covered up.
Shawn Wenzel,@shawnwenzel,Egyptian Pharaohs,Alexander the Great took over Egypt from the Persians in 332 BC. After he died  Egypt was ruled by his general Ptolemy I and passed down to his descendants. They called themselves "pharaoh" even though they were not descended from ancient pharaohs and were not even Egyptian! 2/
Mr Reagan,@MrReaganUSA,Egyptian Pharaohs,So many black Americans think they're descended from Egyptian pharaohs. It's bizarre. Someone needs to teach black people about the Sahara desert.
@coach23,@coach23life,Egyptian Pharaohs,Egyptian government does not have monopoly over Egyptian history. Other nations also had good information about Queen Cleopatra as well. Romans had intimate knowledge of Egypt - after all Cleopatra had special relationship with Julius Caesar. Kushites Pharaohs were dark skinned.
Yitagesu Ambaye (Teagues Wed Embaye),@yitagesuambaye,Egyptian Pharaohs,Why do you think the Egyptian Sphinxes have their noses deliberately disfigured?   Was it because these sculptures had the noses of black people; flat and narrow  not pointy and thick like that of the Caucasians?  Were the Pharaohs mostly likely black people  of Nilotic origin?
